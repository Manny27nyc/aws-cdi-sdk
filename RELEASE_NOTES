CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) SDK Version 2.x.x - XX/XX/XXXX
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New
------------

* Added internal reference count to Logger state data. NOTE: Each time CdiLoggerInitialize() is called,
  CdiLoggerShutdown() must be called once. The test applications have been updated to call CdiLoggerShutdown().

Bug Fixes
------------

* Fixed problems with multiple calls to CdiCoreInitialize(). See https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/issues/34

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) SDK Version 2.0.2 - 01/08/2021
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New
------------

* Added initial version of the SDK coding style guide. See CODE_STYLE_GUIDE.md.
* Replaced CdiLoggerSetGlobalLog() API with new CdiLogGlobalGet() API, which returns the global log handle created
  via CdiCoreInitialize() API. The deprecated API did not serve any functional purpose.
* Added Windows targets for generating DLLs for the CDI-AWS SDK library. See use of Debug_DLL and Release_DLL in the
  Visual Studio solution and project files. Details at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/pull/26
* Added use of the CDI_INTERFACE define to APIs that were not previously using it. Only affects the new Windows DLL
  targets.
* When using CdiOsMemAllocHugePage() API on Linux, the size of bytes allocated must be a multiple of
  HUGE_PAGES_BYTE_SIZE. See definition in cdi_os_api.h. If not, the memory will not be freed when using the
  CdiOsMemFreeHugePage() API.
* Renamed the queue type kQueueMultipleWriters to kQueueMultipleWritersFlag to clarify that the value is a flag,
  not an OS signal type. See include/cdi_queue_api.h.
* Added defines to uniquely identify the CDI transport protocol used by the SDK. See the CDI_PROTOCOL_VERSION,
  CDI_PROTOCOL_MAJOR_VERSION and CDI_PROTOCOL_MINOR_VERSION in include/cdi_core_api.h.

Bug Fixes
------------

* Fixed a problem in RxPollFreeBuffer() that could lead to an assert (segfault in debug build) in CdiListRemove() when
  trying to remove an entry from an empty list.
* Fixed a Rx adapter buffer memory leak when using the CdiCoreRxFreeBuffer() API from multiple threads.
* Fixed a seg-fault when using the CdiLoggerMultilineEnd() API from multiple threads.
* Fixed a seg-fault in the Windows variant when logging to stdout and stdout did not exist. The global logger created
  via CdiCoreInitialize() API is now used instead of stdout. Details at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdi-sdk/pull/25
* Fixed problem with Linux Makefile that could cause the AWS-SDK to always partially re-build on Linux.

CDI (Cloud Digital Interface) SDK Version 2.0.0 - 12/14/2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New
------------
* Documentation updates.
* Added support for additional AVM baseline profiles. See new types/APIs in include/baseline_profile_api.h.
* Added AVM Baseline profile 2.00.
* Added configuration settings to the following structures:
   * CdiTxConfigData: Added max_simultaneous_tx_payloads and max_simultaneous_tx_payload_sgl_entries.
   * CdiRxConfigData: Added max_simultaneous_rx_payloads_per_connection.
   These settings were previously statically defined. To use the static values, set these to zero. NOTE. Use memset or a
   zero structure initializer (= {0}) to set the whole structure to zero before setting the desired members to the
   actual values required.
* Added new core utility APIs for getting TAI time. See CdiCoreGetPtpTimestamp() and CdiCoreGetTaiTimeMicroseconds().
* Added new OS types and APIs for using statically allocated mutexes. See CdiStaticMutexType,
  CDI_STATIC_MUTEX_INITIALIZER, CdiOsStaticMutexLock() and CdiOsStaticMutexUnlock().
* Added new OS portable type for use by the CdiOsSocket...() APIs to hold socket instance data (ie. port number). This
  was done so the transmit side socket no longer has to call connect(), thus preventing failed sends due to ICMP port
  unreachable responses. See CdiSocket.
* Moved the Logger to the public API. Header file is located at include/cdi_logger_api.h.
* Moved the Queue to the public API. Header file is located at include/cdi_queue_api.h. Also, added support for multiple
  writers. See the new types kQueueSignalModeMask and kQueueMultipleWriters.
* Added new OS portable type for converting between nanoseconds and seconds. See NANOSECONDS_PER_SECOND.
* Added number of bytes transferred to statistics. See num_bytes_transferred in cdi_core_api.h and BytesTransferred in
  cloudwatch_sdk_metrics.cpp.

Bug Fixes
------------
* Several connection related issues and segfaults as described in published GitHub issues.
